Each journal entry is securely associated with the user who created it.

3. **User-Friendly Interface:**
Clean and intuitive interface for seamless navigation and journal management.
  
4. **Security:**
JWT authentication to protect user data and ensure secure access.
  
5. **Scalability:**
Built on Spring Boot and Hibernate, capable of handling numerous users and journals.

## Prerequisites

**Java Development Kit (JDK)** 11 or higher
**Maven** 3.6+
**MySQL** or any other supported relational database
An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Installation
Clone this repository.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tushar21014/SpringBoot-API/tree/main
```
```bash
   cd JournalApp
```

## Set up the database:

Create a new database in MySQL (or your preferred RDBMS).<br/>
Update the application.properties file with your database credentials.

```bash
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/journaldb
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
## Build the project:
```bash
    mvn clean install
```

## Run the application:
```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Access the application:
The application will run on http://localhost:8080. <br/>
Use Postman or any other API client to test the CRUD operations and JWT authentication.<br/>


## Usage
Register a new user:
Send a POST request to /api/users/register with user data in the request body.

Login:
Send a POST request to /api/users/login with valid credentials. You will receive a JWT token upon successful login.

### Access User Data:
Include the received JWT token in the Authorization header for authenticated routes to access user data.

### CRUD Operations:

- Create: Send a POST request to /users/add with new journal data.
- Read: Send a GET request to /users/search to fetch user journal details.
- Update: Send a PUT request to /users/:journalId with updated user journal data.
- Delete: Send a DELETE request to /users/:journalId to delete a journal.
